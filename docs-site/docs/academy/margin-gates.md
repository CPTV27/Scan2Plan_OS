# Margin Gates

Margin gates protect profitability by warning or blocking low-margin quotes.

## 40% Gross Margin Floor

Quotes with less than **40% gross margin** trigger a warning:

- Red shield icon appears
- Quote cannot be sent without acknowledgment
- CEO role can acknowledge and proceed

## Margin Calculation

```
Gross Margin % = (Total Price - Direct Costs) / Total Price × 100
```

## Override Process

1. CEO reviews the quote
2. Acknowledges the margin warning
3. Documents strategic reason
4. Quote can proceed

## Best Practices

- Review low-margin quotes for pricing errors
- Consider scope adjustments to improve margin
- Use risk factors if complexity justifies pricing
- Document strategic decisions for accountability
