# Production Workflow

Manage active projects through scanning to delivery.

## Production Stages

1. **Scheduling**: Project created, waiting for scan date
2. **Scanning**: Field tech on-site capturing data
3. **Processing**: Raw data cleaned and registered
4. **Modeling**: BIM model creation
5. **QC**: Quality control check
6. **Delivered**: Sent to client
7. **Archived**: Project complete

## Project Creation

When a lead is moved to **Closed Won**:
1. A project is automatically created
2. Quote data transfers (price, margin, scope)
3. Project appears in Production > Scheduling

## Stage Transitions

Move projects by:
- Drag-and-drop on board view
- Status dropdown in project details
- API automation
