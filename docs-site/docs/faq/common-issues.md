# Common Issues

Frequently encountered problems and solutions.

## UI Issues

### App looks different on mobile?
FieldHub automatically switches to mobile layout when viewport width < 768px. This is intentional for field technicians.

### Dark mode not working?
Check browser settings. The app respects system color scheme preference.

## Data Issues

### Missing leads after import?
Check import log for errors. Common causes:
- Invalid email formats
- Missing required fields
- Duplicate detection

### Quotes not calculating?
Ensure all required fields are filled:
- Building type
- Square footage
- At least one discipline

## Performance Issues

### App running slowly?
- Clear browser cache
- Check network connection
- Try incognito mode
- Report persistent issues to support
