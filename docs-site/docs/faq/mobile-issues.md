# Mobile Issues

Troubleshooting FieldHub mobile app problems.

## Voice Recording

### Microphone not working?
1. Grant microphone permission in browser settings
2. Ensure you're on HTTPS (required for MediaRecorder)
3. Try a different browser
4. Check device microphone is working

## GPS Tracking

### Location not recording?
Common causes:
- Location permissions not granted
- GPS signal weak (indoors, parking garage)
- Browser privacy settings blocking geolocation

:::note
If geolocation fails, Clock In still works but location won't be recorded.
