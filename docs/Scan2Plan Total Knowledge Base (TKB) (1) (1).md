## **E. 🌱 Our Commitment to Sustainability, Adaptive Reuse, Historic Preservation, and Cultural Heritage** {#e.-🌱-our-commitment-to-sustainability,-adaptive-reuse,-historic-preservation,-and-cultural-heritage}

At **Scan2Plan**, our mission extends beyond precision scanning and modeling. **We are committed to shaping a more sustainable, culturally rich built environment** by supporting adaptive reuse, historic preservation, and the protection of cultural heritage. Our work is guided by the belief that **preserving the past builds a better future** — one that is more environmentally responsible, historically significant, and architecturally enduring.

---

### **🌱 Sustainability & Adaptive Reuse**

The construction industry is responsible for approximately **35% of global energy consumption, 38% of carbon dioxide emissions, and 33% of the world’s waste**. We see this as a profound opportunity to make a difference. Instead of demolition and reconstruction, **adaptive reuse** allows existing structures to be reimagined, repurposed, and brought to new life.

**Why It Matters**:

* **Reduces Waste** – Every wall, beam, and column we help preserve is one less item sent to a landfill.  
* **Saves Embodied Energy** – Preserving existing structures conserves the energy that went into their original construction.  
* **Reduces Carbon Footprint** – By limiting the need for new materials, adaptive reuse actively supports the global fight against climate change.

**How We Contribute**:

* **BIM Models for Adaptive Reuse** – By digitizing existing buildings into BIM models, Scan2Plan enables architects and engineers to analyze, remodel, and reuse key structural elements.  
* **Data-Driven Design** – Our precision scanning and modeling provide detailed data that informs decisions on what can be reused vs. what must be replaced.

**Impact Example**: A client seeking to convert an old industrial warehouse into modern office space can use Scan2Plan’s BIM models to identify which columns, beams, and materials can remain intact — saving time, money, and environmental impact.

---

### **🏛️ Historic Preservation & Cultural Heritage**

The world's most iconic and historically significant buildings are more than just structures — they are **living pieces of history**. At Scan2Plan, we recognize the **cultural importance of these landmarks** and see it as our duty to preserve them for future generations. **Our Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM) process allows for precise documentation of intricate architectural details** like carvings, stone reliefs, and ornamental features.

**Why It Matters**:

* **Protects Architectural Legacy** – Preserving hand-carved details, period-specific joinery, and stained glass ensures that the stories of the past remain visible for the future.  
* **Supports HBIM (Historic Building Information Modeling)** – Unlike standard BIM, **HBIM models include heritage-specific elements** that account for unique craftsmanship and site-specific preservation needs.  
* **Supports Grant & Funding Compliance** – Many historic preservation grants require precise documentation, and **HBIM deliverables meet these requirements**.

**How We Contribute**:

* **HBIM (LoD 350+ Custom Detail Models)** – We go beyond standard LoD 200, 300, and 350 models, offering **custom LoD 350+ HBIM models** that include carvings, sculptures, and unique architectural features.  
* **3D Documentation for Restoration** – Our 3D scanning technology enables heritage sites to be fully documented before restoration begins, providing a reference to return the site to its original form if needed.  
* **Cross-Disciplinary Approach** – We incorporate all four core disciplines (**Architecture, Structure, MEPF, and Landscape**) into our HBIM models, ensuring the entire context of a historic site is represented.

**Impact Example**: When restoring a historic church with ornate stone carvings, Scan2Plan's 3D scans and LoD 350+ HBIM models capture every curve, relief, and ornament, ensuring future restoration can be done with **absolute historical fidelity**.

---

### **🤝 Why We Do It**

Our commitment to sustainability, adaptive reuse, and historic preservation goes beyond financial incentives. **We believe that every preserved beam, every restored column, and every repurposed warehouse is a victory for the environment, for cultural heritage, and for the future of design.**

**Our Core Values That Drive This Work**:

* **Preservation of History** – We respect the craftsmanship and cultural importance of historic buildings and see it as our duty to safeguard their legacy.  
* **Sustainable Design** – Reducing the demand for new materials and enabling reuse reduces waste and embodied carbon.  
* **Equity in Design** – By making sophisticated tools like **BIM, HBIM, and adaptive reuse models accessible to architects of all sizes**, we ensure that **smaller firms have access to world-class tools**.

"Buildings are more than structures — they are **time capsules** of human ingenuity. By preserving them, we preserve not just history, but a greener, more sustainable future."

* **Why It Matters**: Speed is critical for projects on tight deadlines. Scan2Plan’s rapid scanning means design teams can move forward quickly without waiting weeks for site access.

**Example:** A design firm working on a hotel renovation needs site data to begin schematic design. By getting scans completed within 1 week, the firm can start planning immediately.

## ---

### **2️⃣ Accuracy & Precision**

* **What It Means**: Scan2Plan ensures models meet the industry's most rigorous accuracy standards:  
  * **LoA 40** for measured accuracy (0-1/8” tolerance) for point cloud data.  
  * **LoA 30** for modeled accuracy (0-1/2” tolerance) for BIM and CAD models.  
* **Why It Matters**: This level of precision supports **clash detection, coordination, and high-confidence construction builds**. Projects benefit from dependable accuracy that aligns with industry standards like **USIBD LoA 40 & LoA 30**.

**Example:** A general contractor coordinating MEPF systems can be confident that the models they use will not result in unexpected site conflicts, minimizing costly construction rework.

## ---

### **3️⃣ Comprehensive Support**

* **What It Means**: Clients receive **ongoing support even after project delivery**, ensuring that files can be used, accessed, and integrated into client workflows.  
* **How It Works**:  
  * **File Conversion**: If clients need help converting RCP files to E57 or other formats, support is provided.  
  * **Usage Support**: Scan2Plan provides support for Revit, Archicad, and AutoCAD files.  
  * **Re-Export Requests**: If a client loses a file or needs an additional export, they can request it at any time (since files are retained indefinitely).  
* **Why It Matters**: Clients are never left without support. If issues arise with file formats, conversions, or compatibility, clients have a team ready to help.

**Example:** An architecture firm realizes two months after delivery that they need the point cloud in **E57 format instead of RCP**. Scan2Plan responds immediately and delivers the converted file within hours.

## ---

### **4️⃣ Unlimited Revisions**

* **What It Means**: If the deliverables do not meet client expectations, **Scan2Plan will revise the model until it meets client needs** (as long as the request is within the original scope).  
* **How It Works**:  
  * After the first delivery, clients have a **review period** where they can request changes.  
  * Revisions are completed at no extra charge unless the client expands the scope (like requesting additional areas or higher LoD).  
* **Why It Matters**: Clients have peace of mind knowing that they won’t be “stuck” with an inaccurate model. Revisions are part of the process, not an extra cost.

**Example:** After receiving a BIM model, the client requests that door swings be included in LoD 300 (which is within scope). Scan2Plan makes the revisions within 48 hours, ensuring total client satisfaction.

---

## **B. 📉 LoD (Level of Detail) Breakdown** {#b.-📉-lod-(level-of-detail)-breakdown}

The **Level of Detail (LoD)** defines the amount of graphical and functional detail represented in **BIM and CAD models**. LoD serves two distinct purposes:

1. **Level of Detail (Graphical Detail)** – The visual and graphical complexity of the elements in the model.  
2. **Level of Development (Completeness)** – The extent to which the model is ready for fabrication, coordination, and construction.

Scan2Plan supports the creation of models at **LoD 200, 300, 350, and 350+ (HBIM)**, which are aligned with **BIM Forum and AIA standards**. These LoD categories define the level of completeness and detail required for different project phases, from concept design to full construction-ready models.

---

### **1️⃣ What is LoD?**

LoD (Level of Detail) is a framework that defines how much graphical information is included in a BIM/CAD model. It sets clear expectations for what elements will be included, how detailed they will be, and how "ready" the model is for construction, clash detection, or preservation work.

#### **Dual Purpose of LoD**

| Purpose | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Graphical Detail** | How visually detailed the model is (e.g., massing vs. full geometry). |
| **Model Completeness** | How “developed” or “finalized” an element is for construction use. |

**Why It Matters**: When clients know the LoD, they know **exactly what they’re getting** in terms of detail, accuracy, and development. This clarity reduces scope misunderstandings, change orders, and revision requests.

---

### **2️⃣ LoD Definitions**

| LoD | Definition & Key Use Case | Typical Use |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **LoD 200** | **Schematic Design**: Basic massing models with limited geometry. | Feasibility studies, conceptual design. |
| **LoD 300** | **Construction-Ready**: Essential architectural features only. | Construction documents, permits. |
| **LoD 350** | **Construction-Ready (Detailed)**: Refined construction details. | Construction coordination, clash detection. |
| **LoD 350+** | **Historic Preservation (HBIM)**: Custom, site-specific detail. | Preservation, adaptive reuse, heritage conservation. |

**Note**: LoD 350+ is specific to **Historic Building Information Modeling (HBIM)** and includes unique historical details like **carvings, sculptures, and heritage-specific ornamentation**.

---

### **3️⃣ Key Differences Between LoD 200, 300, 350, and 350+**

## **C. 🖼️ LoA (Level of Accuracy) Breakdown** {#c.-🖼️-loa-(level-of-accuracy)-breakdown}

The **Level of Accuracy (LoA)** defines how precisely a 3D model or point cloud aligns with real-world measurements. Unlike **LoD (Level of Detail)**, which determines the **visual detail** of model elements, **LoA** controls how closely those elements match their **true, real-world dimensions**.

At Scan2Plan, LoA is broken into two critical categories:

* **LoA 40 (Measured Accuracy)** – The accuracy of the raw **point cloud** relative to the physical structure.  
* **LoA 30 (Modeled Accuracy)** – The accuracy of the **BIM/CAD model** relative to the point cloud data.

This distinction is essential because **point clouds can achieve higher precision** than models, which are constrained by software tools, user interpretation, and project scope. **Every Scan2Plan project guarantees LoA 40 for point clouds and LoA 30 for BIM/CAD models.**

---

### **1️⃣ What is LoA?**

**LoA (Level of Accuracy)** defines the acceptable tolerance for dimensional accuracy in Scan2Plan deliverables. It ensures alignment between the physical structure, the point cloud scan, and the BIM/CAD model.

| LoA Type | Definition | What It Controls | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **LoA 40 (Measured Accuracy)** | Precision of the **raw point cloud** relative to physical reality. | Ensures scan data is aligned within **0-1/8"**. | Guarantees precise scan data, ensuring reality is fully captured. |
| **LoA 30 (Modeled Accuracy)** | Precision of **modeled BIM/CAD geometry** relative to the point cloud. | Ensures models are accurate within **0-1/2"**. | Ensures construction models accurately reflect the site, with tolerances suitable for construction. |

---

### **2️⃣ Why LoA Matters**

| Key Benefit | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- |
| **Clear Accuracy Expectations** | Clients know exactly how precise their scans and models will be. |
| **Reduced Risk of Rework** | By clearly defining LoA requirements, Scan2Plan reduces client disputes and rework. |
| **Precise Data for Clash Detection** | Accurate models help detect clashes between MEPF systems and architectural features. |
| **Industry Compliance** | LoA aligns with **USIBD LoA Standards**, ensuring consistency across global construction projects. |

---

### **3️⃣ Differences Between LoA 40 and LoA 30**

| Feature | LoA 40 (Measured Accuracy) | LoA 30 (Modeled Accuracy) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |

---

### **4️⃣ How LoA is Measured and Validated**

#### **1️⃣ LoA 40 (Measured Accuracy) – How We Achieve It**

1️⃣ **Trimble RealWorks Registration**

* Use **B-Validation** (overlapping scan comparison) to ensure consistency.  
* Use **C-Validation** (internal control point alignment) to validate the scan-to-scan alignment.

2️⃣ **On-Site Verification**

* Scan technicians review scan coverage **before leaving the site**, ensuring no missing areas exist.

3️⃣ **Accuracy Guarantee**

* All raw point cloud files are verified to ensure LoA 40 (0-1/8” accuracy).

---

#### **2️⃣ LoA 30 (Modeled Accuracy) – How We Achieve It**

1️⃣ **Modeling from Point Cloud**

* BIM modelers use point cloud files (RCP, E57) as a reference for creating Revit, Archicad, and AutoCAD models.  
* LoD standards (LoD 200, 300, 350, and 350+) define how much of the model is developed, but LoA defines how **precisely it aligns** to the physical site.

2️⃣ **QC Checks for Modeled Accuracy**

* Each model element is checked against the point cloud to ensure it is within **0-1/2” of the actual scan**.

3️⃣ **Tools for Validation**

* **Clash Detection** is used for MEPF elements to ensure pipes, ducts, and conduits align properly.  
* Final QC checks are conducted to ensure modeled geometry is consistent with the **LoA 30 standard**.

---

### **5️⃣ LoA Use Cases**

## **3️⃣ 🎯 Accuracy Guarantees** {#3️⃣-🎯-accuracy-guarantees}

**Accuracy is the foundation of Scan2Plan's deliverables.** Every scan, point cloud, and BIM/CAD model is held to the highest industry standards to ensure precision, alignment, and model-to-scan fidelity. **Accuracy is guaranteed through compliance with the USIBD LoA Specification**, which defines how accurate point clouds and models must be relative to real-world site conditions.

This section explains:  
1️⃣ **Accuracy Definitions (LoA 40 vs. LoA 30\)**  
2️⃣ **Accuracy Guarantees for Point Clouds & Models**  
3️⃣ **How Accuracy is Measured and Validated**  
4️⃣ **Tools & Software Used for Validation**  
5️⃣ **Why Accuracy Matters to Clients**

---

## **1️⃣ Accuracy Definitions (LoA 40 vs. LoA 30\)**

Scan2Plan guarantees two levels of accuracy on every project:

* **LoA 40 (Measured Accuracy): 0” to 1/8” tolerance** — This applies to the **point cloud** produced directly from laser scans.  
* **LoA 30 (Modeled Accuracy): 0” to 1/2” tolerance** — This applies to the **BIM/CAD model elements** created from the point cloud.

| LoA Type | Definition | Accuracy Tolerance | What It Controls |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **LoA 40 (Measured Accuracy)** | The accuracy of the point cloud relative to real-world site conditions. | **0-1/8" (Measured)** | Ensures precise alignment of point clouds to the site. |
| **LoA 30 (Modeled Accuracy)** | The accuracy of the modeled elements relative to the point cloud. | **0-1/2" (Modeled)** | Ensures that BIM/CAD elements match point cloud data. |

---

## **2️⃣ Accuracy Guarantees for Point Clouds & Models**

**Scan2Plan guarantees the following levels of accuracy on every project:**

| Deliverable | Accuracy Level | Accuracy Guarantee |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Point Clouds (RCP, E57, LAS, PTS)** | **LoA 40 (0-1/8”)** | Every point cloud has an accuracy of **0-1/8” relative to real-world conditions**. |
| **BIM Models (RVT, PLN, IFC)** | **LoA 30 (0-1/2”)** | Modeled elements have an accuracy of **0-1/2” relative to the point cloud**. |
| **CAD Drawings (DWG, DXF, PDF)** | **LoA 30 (0-1/2”)** | CAD files (DWG, DXF, PDF) are derived from BIM models and share the same LoA 30 accuracy. |

**Note on Modeled Accuracy (LoA 30\)**: LoA 30 accounts for modeler interpretation, Revit/AutoCAD software tolerances, and **human interaction with point cloud data**. This explains why modeled accuracy (0-1/2”) is less precise than scan accuracy (0-1/8”).

---

### **3️⃣ How Accuracy is Measured and Validated**

To achieve **LoA 40 for point clouds** and **LoA 30 for models**, Scan2Plan follows a rigorous validation process.

#### **1️⃣ B-Validation (Cross-Scan Validation)**

* **What It Is**: Ensures overlapping scans align perfectly.  
* **How It Works**: Multiple scans are compared at overlap points. If the alignment exceeds **1/8" tolerance**, the scans are re-registered.  
* **Tools Used**: **Trimble RealWorks** automatically identifies scan misalignments and re-aligns them.

**Why It Matters**: Ensures that the **entire point cloud is internally consistent**, even when multiple scans are stitched together.

---

#### **2️⃣ C-Validation (Control Point Validation)**

* **What It Is**: Validates that scan data aligns with known survey control points.  
* **How It Works**: If control points exist (like those set by a Total Station), point cloud scans are aligned to those points. This method is especially important on projects requiring georeferencing.  
* **Tools Used**: **Trimble RealWorks** for control alignment and **Total Station** for on-site control point capture.

**Why It Matters**: Control point validation is essential for georeferenced point clouds and large infrastructure projects. It guarantees that the scan will align with external survey data, not just itself.

---

#### **3️⃣ Modeled Accuracy Validation (LoA 30 Verification)**

* **What It Is**: Validates that modeled elements in Revit, Archicad, or CAD align with the original point cloud.  
* **How It Works**:  
  1. **Import Point Cloud**: The point cloud (RCP, E57) is imported into Revit or Archicad.  
  2. **Modeling from Point Cloud**: Technicians model elements (walls, doors, beams) based on the cloud's geometry.  
  3. **Model-to-Cloud Validation**: Modeled elements are cross-checked with the point cloud to ensure no more than a **1/2” discrepancy**.  
* **Tools Used**: **Revit, Archicad, Rhino, and AutoCAD** are used for model creation, and **manual spot-checks** are done by QA reviewers.

---

### **4️⃣ Tools & Software Used for Validation**

To ensure accuracy, **Scan2Plan uses industry-leading tools** for scan alignment, validation, and quality control.

| Tool | What It’s Used For | How It Supports LoA 40 & LoA 30 |

| **Electrical Hazards** | Exposed live wires, electrical shocks, or arc flash hazards. |
| **Structural Risks** | If a wall, beam, or structure shows signs of collapse or instability. |

**How the Stop Work Policy Works (Step-by-Step)**  
1️⃣ **Technician Stops Work Immediately** — No client approval is required.  
2️⃣ **Report to Supervisor** — The technician notifies the **Field Operations Supervisor**.  
3️⃣ **Remediation or Escalation** — The supervisor identifies solutions (e.g., improved PPE, site adjustments) or halts the project until the issue is resolved.  
4️⃣ **Client Notification** — If a project is halted, clients are notified with an action plan to resolve the safety issue.

**Example**: If a technician enters a fire-damaged site without Tyvek suits and respirators, they can stop work immediately. Work only resumes after **PPE is provided and air quality is safe.**

---

### **4️⃣ Emergency Response Protocols**

Emergencies like **fire, flood, injury, or structural collapse** can happen on active job sites. **Technicians are trained to follow clear emergency protocols** to protect themselves and other site personnel.

| Emergency Type | Response Protocol |
| ----- | ----- |
| **On-Site Injury** | 1️⃣ Call 911 for emergency medical attention. 2️⃣ Report injury to the Field Operations Supervisor. |
| **Fire or Flood** | 1️⃣ Evacuate site immediately. 2️⃣ Call 911\. 3️⃣ Report to the Project Manager. |
| **Structural Collapse** | 1️⃣ Evacuate immediately. 2️⃣ Report collapse to emergency services (911). 3️⃣ Notify supervisor and wait for re-entry approval. |
| **Air Quality Hazard** | 1️⃣ Evacuate if air quality worsens. 2️⃣ Report the air quality issue to the Field Operations Supervisor. |

---

### **5️⃣ Incident Reporting & Risk Reduction**

If an incident (injury, accident, or safety issue) occurs on-site, it is reported and analyzed to reduce future risk. Every report is logged in the **Airtable Incident Tracker**, and each incident triggers a review to determine if new PPE, training, or policy updates are required.

| Incident Type | How It’s Reported | What Happens Next |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Injury (Technician)** | **Incident Report Form** in Airtable | Supervisor reviews and identifies safety improvements. |
| **Near-Miss (No Injury)** | **Near-Miss Report** in Airtable | Used to track potential risks and reduce recurrence. |
| **PPE Breach (No PPE)** | **Breach Report** submitted to Supervisor | Used to update PPE protocols for future jobs. |

## **3️⃣ 🔒 Data Security & File Protection** {#3️⃣-🔒-data-security-&-file-protection}

**Data security is a critical component of Scan2Plan's risk mitigation strategy.** From point cloud files to Revit models, every client deliverable is treated as **confidential, encrypted, and securely stored**. This ensures that sensitive project data, design files, and client information are never exposed to risk.

---

### **1️⃣ How Data is Protected**

Scan2Plan implements **multi-layered data protection** to prevent file corruption, data loss, or unauthorized access. Protection measures cover three key areas:

| Data Protection Area | How It’s Protected | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **File Security (Encryption & Access Control)** | All client files are encrypted, and access is restricted to authorized personnel only. | Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive client files. |
| **File Storage & Redundancy** | Files are stored on **Google Drive** with redundant backups on **physical tape drives**. | Ensures files are never lost and can be recovered at any time. |
| **File Sharing & Transfer Security** | Files are shared via password-protected **Google Drive** and secure links for Autodesk Fusion & Trimble Clarity. | Prevents unauthorized access to download links and ensures clients have secure access. |

---

### **2️⃣ File Encryption & Access Control**

**All files are encrypted before transfer or storage** to protect against unauthorized access. Only authorized Scan2Plan employees have access to client files, and role-based permissions ensure that employees only have access to the files they need for their specific roles.

| Security Measure | How It Works | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **File Encryption** | Files are encrypted during upload, download, and storage. | Ensures that files are unreadable if intercepted. |
| **Access Permissions** | Access is limited to **authorized employees** only. | Prevents unauthorized employees from viewing client files. |
| **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** | Employee logins require **2FA for Google Drive** access. | Ensures that only verified users can access shared files. |
| **Password-Protected Links** | File-sharing links are password-protected and can be set to "view only." | Prevents unauthorized access to shared links. |

**Example**: If a client requests Revit files via Google Drive, Scan2Plan will send a **password-protected link** that only the client can access.

---

### **3️⃣ File Storage & Backup Policy**

Scan2Plan guarantees that **all client files are retained indefinitely** and **backed up in multiple locations** to prevent data loss. Even if a natural disaster, hardware failure, or security breach occurs, files can be fully restored.

| Backup Type | Where Files Are Stored | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Primary Storage** | **Google Drive (Cloud-Based)** | Cloud storage allows for fast file sharing and secure backups. |
| **Redundant Backup** | **Physical Tape Backup (On-Premises)** | Ensures that files are still accessible, even if Google Drive is compromised. |
| **File Replication** | Files are mirrored across multiple drives. | If one system fails, data can be recovered from a secondary source. |
| **File Retention** | **Files are retained indefinitely**. | Clients can request access to files at any point in the future. |

---

### **4️⃣ File Sharing & Transfer Security**

Clients receive files using secure file-sharing platforms, like:

* **Google Drive** (encrypted file sharing with password-protected links)  
* **Autodesk Fusion 360** (browser-based model viewer, access-controlled)  
* **Trimble Clarity** (browser-based point cloud viewer, password-protected)

| File Sharing Method | How It’s Secure | Files Shared |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Google Drive** | **Password-protected links** with file expiration. | BIM (RVT, IFC, PLN), CAD (DWG, DXF), point clouds (RCP, E57, LAS). |
| **Autodesk Fusion 360** | Client access requires a **secure link** to view models in the browser. | BIM models (RVT, IFC) are available for browser-based viewing. |
| **Trimble Clarity** | Secure link to view, annotate, and measure point clouds in the browser. | Point cloud files (RCP, E57) can be visualized and measured without local software. |

---

### **5️⃣ How Client Data is Kept Private**

**Client data confidentiality** is a core part of Scan2Plan’s file protection process. Files are never shared with third parties without client permission. **All client data is encrypted and stored securely**, and only authorized Scan2Plan employees have access to client deliverables.

| Privacy Measure | How It Works | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **File Confidentiality** | Client files (RVT, DWG, RCP) are only accessible to **authorized Scan2Plan employees**. | Prevents exposure of sensitive design or building information. |
| **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)** | NDAs are signed for sensitive projects. | Ensures that client data is not shared with 3rd parties. |
| **Limited Employee Access** | Role-based permissions ensure that only certain employees can access specific files. | Ensures that only authorized personnel can see or modify files. |
| **Client-Controlled File Sharing** | Clients can request specific controls on shared files (like download-only access). | Clients maintain control over **who can view, download, or modify files.** |

**Example**: On sensitive projects (like **historic preservation or proprietary commercial buildings**), Scan2Plan can sign an **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement)** to protect client confidentiality. Files are shared on a "view-only" basis to ensure data security.

---

## **4️⃣ Project Scope Control** {#4️⃣-project-scope-control}

**Controlling project scope is essential for reducing risk, avoiding scope creep, and maintaining clear client expectations.** By clearly defining LoD, LoA, and square footage requirements at the outset, Scan2Plan ensures that clients know **exactly what they are paying for** and what deliverables they will receive.

---

### **1️⃣ How Project Scope is Defined**

Every project begins with a **formal proposal** and **scope agreement**. The proposal clearly defines the key aspects of scope, including:

| Scope Element | How It’s Defined | Why It Matters |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Total Square Footage** | Based on client estimates (but later confirmed with a Square Footage Audit). | Ensures clear cost expectations. If the scanned square footage exceeds the estimate by more than 10%, the invoice is adjusted. |
| **LoD (Level of Detail)** | Clients choose LoD 200, 300, 350, or 350+ for each discipline (Architecture, Structure, MEPF, Landscape). | LoD determines modeling time, cost, and visual detail. |
| **LoA (Level of Accuracy)** | **LoA 40 (0-1/8” Measured Accuracy)** for point clouds, **LoA 30 (0-1/2” Modeled Accuracy)** for BIM/CAD models. | Ensures clarity on how accurate models and point clouds must be. |
| **Disciplines** | Client specifies which disciplines are included (Architecture, Structure, MEPF, Landscape). | Each discipline increases project scope, complexity, and cost. |
| **Scope Areas** | Client identifies the specific areas to be scanned (interior, exterior, full building, or partial areas). | Ensures Scan2Plan only scans relevant areas, preventing unnecessary work. |
| **Deliverables** | Specifies which file formats are required (RVT, DWG, PDF, E57, etc.). | Deliverables impact processing time and software requirements for production. |

**How It’s Documented**: All of these details are included in the **Project Proposal**. Clients must review and sign the proposal to lock in the project scope. This signed agreement becomes the reference point for any future change orders.

---

### **Summary of Key Clarifications**

1️⃣ **Scope Definitions**: Scope is defined in contracts (square footage, LoD, LoA, disciplines, and deliverables).  
2️⃣ **Scope Creep Prevention**: New work requires a **change order**.  
3️⃣ **Impact of LoD, LoA, and Disciplines**: Each of these elements affects scope size, cost, and delivery time.

## **5️⃣ Client Dispute Resolution**

**Disputes are resolved quickly, transparently, and fairly.** Scan2Plan follows a 5-step process to handle client issues related to scope, square footage, file formats, and deliverable quality. Disputes are logged in Airtable, and resolutions are guided by the **original project scope, Square Footage Audit, Change Order process, and Unlimited Revisions Policy**. If a client disputes square footage or LoD quality, **Scan2Plan provides clear documentation (like the Square Footage Audit)** and offers **unlimited revisions at no extra cost**. Payment disputes are resolved using a **10% tolerance rule** — if the scanned area is more than 10% larger than the client’s estimate, the invoice is adjusted accordingly.

---

### **Dispute Resolution Process (Chart View)**

| Step | Action | Outcome |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **1️⃣ Issue Identified** | Client reports a dispute (quality, scope, payment, etc.). | Issue is logged in Airtable. |
